          <h5>How it all started...</h5>
          <p>I was leading the UX and Design of the Speciality Stores (the new Ocado's General Merchandise Platform) when the Head of eCommerce OSP approached me with the OSP's headaches. He asked me if I could spend a bit of my [free] time to support OSP with some visuals, thus to solve probably the most diminutive of all issues. Regardless of being fully aware that a few made-up nice graphics would not have solved the bigger problem, enthusiastically I agreed to help out.</p>
          <p class="gf-h3 gf-text-lh-med">After a few weeks of fun in putting together visual concepts and a long-term vision, I pitched the need for design to facilitate and speed up the delivery of the Ocado Smart Platform.</p>
          <p class="gf-add-bottom-space">Soon after, I was officially responsible for initiating and leading the UX and Design Chapter of the Ocado Smart Platform.</p>
          <p class="gf-text-small">PS: I had to split my responsibilities between starting the new Design Chapter in OSP and leading the Design of the Speciality Stores for the first six months. I moved full-time to OSP soon after launching Fabled.com, the beauty commerce site built in partnership with Marie Claire.</p>

This is the beginning of the development of a suite of solutions that will be built upon the Ocado retail experience and the in-house technology.</p>
          <p class="gf-h3 gf-text-lh-med">Because of its technology-driven culture, in the Ocado Smart Platform team all efforts where put on the engineering work, leaving design [and a bit of product planning] aside.</p>
          <p>After several month of development, all applications looked poorly built and disconnected. It become clear to some that something had to change in order to properly build and scale an ecosystem.</p>

          <p class="gf-h3 gf-text-lh-med">Hire the right designer vs the best designers.</p>
          <p>After struggling in finding adequate senior designers (mostly because of location), I changed my strategy. I started looking for young fast-learners designers with a mindset focused on problem-solving and excited to jump into madness.</p>
          <p>To not let things to chances and facilitate the young designers' success, I spent a good junk of my time with their future stakeholders to set expectations as well as setting up a training framework.</p>
          <p>After the first two hires, I started raising the experience level. My goal was to set up a team with a diverse class of experience so to spread responsibilities and ownership properly.</p>
          <p>The team grew organically across different office locations without the rush. Each member of the Design Chapter worked in cross-functional teams while supporting each other and the Chapter by leading activities such as the UX Academy, the Research community, the UX two-weeks work experience for PMs and Developers, etc.</p>

          <h3>The OSP Tube Map</h3>
          <p>How can we clearly explain internally and externally how OSP works, from B2B to the B2C online shop? Inspired by the London tube map, we conceived and created the OSP Tube Map, a user journey map of the platform's functionality.</p>
          <p class="gf-h3 gf-text-lh-med">In a visual story-teller way, the OSP Tube Map described the flow, and all the retailer and its customer's needed actions to complete the purchase's process.</p>
          <p>The map was regularly updated with new ideated and released features. A beautiful, enormous printed wall version of the map was made available in all Ocado Technology offices (often used efficiently in workshops and brainstorming).</p>

          <h3>Aeris, the Design System for the OSP B2B</h3>
          <p>I partnered with the most senior front-end engineer to design and develop a unified design language [the first step to become an MVP of a Design System]. We started with Bootstrap to then move into a more ad hoc solution built with React and Angular.</p>
          <p class="gf-h3 gf-text-lh-med">When serving 20+ product teams spread out in different international locations, delivering a centralised front-end experience was a very bumpy journey.</p>
          <p>Every designer working on the B2B products [embedded in multi-disciplinary teams] were actively contributing to enhance the capability and adequately scale the Design System. Unfortunately, we couldn't afford to have a dedicated team of designers. We couldn't afford to have a dedicate team of engineers, either. All the engineering work was volunteer-based, and only God knows how grateful I have been towards those lovely people.
          <p>After three years from the first Aeris release, and after Kroger (US retailer) signing into OSP, the time was right to set up a dedicated team of engineers to work fulltime on the OSP Design System.</p><p class="gf-text-small">PS: On its fourth version, the team decided to rename Aeris DS to OSP DS as a sign of its maturity.</p>

        <h3>Fraisy, the Design System and language for the OSP B2C</h3>
        <p>The Ocado retail and eCommerce OSP team were looking at the customer-facing experience from the rear mirror instead of looking ahead. They expected to copy and paste the current ocado.com experience to the OSP online shop.</p>
        <p>With my experience in designing Ocado.com and the support of a two-year product roadmap, I embraced my responsibility and delivered the vision of the OSP B2C products. Essentially, I designed the future version of Ocado.com (yes, Ocado will eventually be using the Ocado Smart Platform).</p>
        <p class="gf-h3 gf-text-lh-med">Regardless of some friction caused by some stakeholders on my vision, component after component, we started building the online shop. After several iterations and learnings in the making, the eCommerce team started releasing a customer experience that pleased the business as well as newly acquired and potential clients.</p>
        <p>In my time working on it, OSP became a chosen solution to many international retailers such as Kruger (US), Sobeys (Canada), Groupe Casino (France), Bonpreu (Catalogna), Ica (Sweden), and Morrisons (UK).</p>

        <h3>Introducing Design Thinking.</h3>
        <p>Design Thinking is often misunderstood because of its over-complicated consultancy style definition and strict methodology. Design Thinking, as I see it, is a straightforward yet powerful process and mindset that when properly understood and applied, can open doors to extraordinary opportunities.</p>
        <p>To deliver that message and <b>to build a firm bridge between design, product and tech</b>, I planned and facilitated Design Thinking workshops across multiple and diverse teams in all the Ocado Technology offices. Using ordinary life examples as a way to explain Design Thinking not only triggered interest and engagement but helped the participants to understand the meaning of being human-centric quickly.</p>

            <p>Without any doubt, OSP would have had still a happy ending. Maybe it would have taken longer delivery times and be more costly; Perhaps negotiations with retailers' brand and marketing teams would have been more challenging. I'm almost sure it would have been messier and uglier.</p>
            <p>Who knows. As any philosopher would point out, the if/else conditional statement is always meaningless. What counts are my good old memories, the fun and pain in working with bright minds <del>careless</del> clueless about design, and the current colossal success of OSP.</p>

          <p>OSP became a chosen solution to colossal international retailers such as Kruger (US), Sobeys (Canada), Groupe Casino (France), Bonpreu (Catalogna), Ica (Sweden), and Morrisons (UK).</p>
          <p><b>Today Ocado is one of the most technologicall and commercially relevant brands in the world.</b></p>
          <p>After the massive success – strategically and financially – that signing Kroger brought to Ocado in 2018, it came clear to me that, after four intense years in the making, from a design perspective, the <del>hard job</del> fun was over.  The next two-years roadmap and with the ongoing leadership re-organisation, from that moment on, it was all about delivering the commitment.</p>
          <p class="gf-h3 gf-text-lh-med">I wanted to push for excellence; however, "good enough design" was sufficient to please the business (perhaps rightly so at that stage), and that it is what we delivered.</p>
          <p>Respectfully, it was time for me to move on to pastures new. On the bright side, my departure proposed the opportunity for some of my beloved senior designers to take leadership roles and shape the products according to their vision; undoubtedly, I'll always be cheering for them.</p>

           <p>I made the protagonist of the story the Board management team instead of the client. Focusing on the client/customer would have meant losing the sight of the business goal and it would have delayed a lot the delivery of the Platform. 
            I took the responsibility to hold the business' hands and subtly nudge them in the right direction.</p>
