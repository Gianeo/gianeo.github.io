      <ul>
        <li>Blue personalities</li>
        <li>Former engineers promoted to leadership roles</li>
        <li>None or very poor exposure and experience with design</li>
      </ul> -->

      <p>All begins with an idea; the idea to develop a platform to empower worldwide retail grocery businesses to operate online successfully like Ocado is doing in the UK. This is the beginning of the development of a suite of solutions that will be built upon the Ocado retail experience and the in-house technology.</p>
      <p>Because of its technology-driven culture, in the Ocado Smart Platform team all efforts where put on the engineering work, leaving design thinking [and a bit of product planning] aside.</p>
      <p>After several month of development, it become clear to some that something had to change. All applications looked poorly built and disconnected from that desired ecosystem.</p>

      <!-- <h1>Your hero has a problem. What is it?</h1> -->
      <ol>
        <li>Explaining the functionality and architecture of the platform to normal human beings was cumbersome.</li>
        <li>Because dev teams worked autonomously from each other (without any design chapter), each app worked and looked differently from the other. Platform's coherence was missing and the demo sessions regularly showcased how the customer experience was broken.</li>
        <li>The assumption of being able to simply copy ocado.com for the B2C revealved to have been a not functional idea; too many user experience nuances and design requirements were not considered.</li>
    </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <!-- <h1>Who or what is their guide in solving the problem?</h1> -->
      <h4>My role</h4>
      <p>I was leading the UX and Design of the Speciality Store (General Merchindise Platform) when the Head of eCommerce OSP approached me to share his challenges. He asked me if I could spend a bit of my time to support OSP with some designs thus to primarily solve problem #2. And of course, a few designs would not have solved the problem but enthusisastically I agreed in helping out.</p>
      <p>Few weeks later, with visual concepts to support my vision, I pitched the need of design to takkle the OSP challenges.</p>
      <p>Soon after, I was officially leading the UX and design for the Ocado Smart Platform.</p>
      <p>PS: For the first six months, I had to split my responsibilities between OSP and Leading the Design for the Speciality Stores; I would have moved full-time to OSP soon after launching Fabled.com, the beauty commerce site built in partnership with Marie Claire.</p>

    <section>
      <!-- <h1>What's the plan they need to follow to achieve the transformation?</h1> -->
      <h4>The plan</h4>
      <p>To move as fast as I needed, I identified three problems where I should put my focus on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span><i class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-right"></i></span>Bring a consistent and fluid experience across all B2B apps</li>
          <li><span><i class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-right"></i></span>Build a new eCommerce experience with simplicity, scaling, and customisation in mind.</li>
          <li><span><i class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-right"></i></span>While working on the previous two points, I had to build a team.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
      <!-- <h4>What I need to take advantage of to facilitate success</h4> -->
      <h4>Opportunities</h4>
      <p>Sometimes, challenges can become opportunities. And definitely, this time wasn't an exception.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span><i class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-right"></i></span><b>Management pressure.</b> More pressure meant more visibility and motivation.</li>
        <li><span><i class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-right"></i></span><b>Short timings.</b> Tight deadlines meant license to act, less burocracy and not much asking for permission (fun but risky).</li>
        <li><span><i class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-right"></i></span><b>Clear problems.</b> It's easy to measure someone success when the problems are clear and palpable.</li>
        <li><span><i class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-right"></i></span><b>Changes happened regularly.</b> Things shifted in different directions regularly, that gave me the chance be extremelly agile in decision making and in the design process.</li>

    <section>
      <!-- <h1>The guide call them to action!</h1> -->
      <p>To start delivering consistency and brand across all apps within the Platform, I needed to equip the organisation with a short-term vision and strategy while bringing excitement for the challenge.</p>
      <p>After three months, the Management team started seeing demos of products that were more cohesive within the Platform; they felt as being part of a whole. It didn't take long that board members and a dedicated team started demoing the Platform to potential clients with more confidence.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Building a team.</h4>
      <p>Hire the right designer vs the best designers.
      <p>After struggling in finding valid senior designers (mostly because of location), I changed my strategy and started looking for fast learner humble young talented designers with a strong mindset in problem solving and happy to jump into the mad.</p>
      <p>I spent some time with their future stakeholders so to prepare the field and not let things to chances.</p>
      <p>After the first two hires, I started raising the experience level. My goal was to set up a team with a diverse level of experience so to spread responsibilities and ownership.
      I chose to scale the team according to my team and the other stakeholder maturity with processes.</p>

      <p class="speech-bubble"><b>Problem #1.</b><br>How might we explain the functionality and architecture of the platform to regular human beings?</p>
      <h4>The OSP Tube Map</h4>
      <p>How can we clearly explain internally and externally how OSP works, from B2B to the B2C? Inspired by the London tube map, we concieved and created the OSP Tube Map, a user journey map of the platform's functionality that incorporates all the high-level actions that must be taken by the retailer and shopper to make OSP efficient. Every new feature will be regularly added to the map; and a beautiful, enormous printed wall version of it was made available in our offices across Europe (often used efficiently in workshops and brainstorming).</p>

      <p class="speech-bubble"><b>Problem #2.</b><br>How to bring a coherent look and feel and common functional patterns across all B2B apps?</hp>
      <h4>Aeris, the Design Language and System for B2B</h4>
      <p>I partnered with the most senior front-end engineer to design and develop a unified design language [to then becomea an MVP of a Design System]. We started with Bootstrap to then move into a more ad hoc solution built in React and Angular.</p>
      <p>When serving 20+ product teams spread out in different sites in Europe, delivering a unified front-end experience is a very bumpy journey.</p>
      <p>After three versions and many love/hate conversations, a dedicated ad hoc full-time team of engineers was built to facilitate and optimise the building and delivery of a more robust Design System.</p>

      <p class="speech-bubble"><b>Problem #3.</b><br>How to design an eCommerce grocery user experience that is derived by the Ocado experience but is customisable and flexible to accomodate most of the needs of any Worldwide retailer regardless of business model, customer base, language, regulations, currency, ... ?</p>
      <div class="columns is-gapless">
        <div class="column is-5 gf-col-text-right">
          <h4>Fraisy, the Design Language and System for B2C</h4>
      <p>The Ocado retail and eCommerce OSP team were looking at the customer-facing experience from the rear mirror instead of looking ahead. They expected to copy and paste the current ocado.com to the OSP experience.</p>
      <p>Because of my experience in designing Ocado.com web shop and apps as well as having the confidence and experience as a designer, I was well aware of what would have worked and what not at this stage (MVP thinking). I took initiative and the risk to design the vision for the OSP B2C products; essentially the next version of Ocado.com (yes, Ocado will eventually be using the Ocado Smart Platform).</p>
      <p>Regardless of some friction and fatigue from some stakeholders on my vision, we started, piece by piece, building the components. After several iterations and learnings in the making, the eCommerce team started releasing a customer experience that pleased and fulfilled the brand customisation and business needs of acquired clients as well as capturing the attention of several interested retailers. OSP became a chosen solution to many international retailers such as Kruger (US), Sobeys (Canada), Casino and Monoprix (France), Bonpreu (Catalogna), Ica (Sweden), and Morrisons (UK).</p>
      <p>The customer-facing commerce experience was build upon a component-based Design System initiated by me and then scaled and developed by the developers and designers of the OSP eCommerce team.</p>

      <!-- <h1>What are the stakes? With no stakes, there is no reason to care.</h1> -->
      <h4>What are the stakes?</h4>

      <h6>What would have happened without me?</h6>
      <p>We tend to look back when something didn't work as expected, i.e. post-mortems.
        We never look back to understand why something worked well and succeeded.
        No one would ever know what OSP would have been today if I didn't spend family time to design what OSP could look as a favour to a friend.</p>
        <p>OSP would have surely still had a happy ending, maybe it would have taken longer, more costly, uglier. Maybe the relationship with a few retailers would have been tougher. But who knows ... and who am I to say what it would have happen if. The if ... else conditional statement is meaningless. What I might think is totally irrelevant, what counts is what I left behind and where Ocado is today.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
      <h4>Finale</h4>
      <p>After four years, I left the OSP team and Ocado with two Design Systems (B2C and B2B), a scalable design and customer-centric commerce experience, and a group of designers and researchers well organised so to facilitate growth.</p>
      <p><b>Today Ocado is one of the most technologicall and commercially relevant brands in the world.</b></p>
      <p>For you blue personalities that put numbers over sentiments, here is probably the most impactful and meaningful business metric you should know about:</p>

           <p>Not the right time to educate on design. I should have talked more in business terms.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
           <h4>Wins</h4>
           <p>I made the protagonist of the story the Board management team instead of the client. Focusing on the client/customer would have meant losing the sight of the business goal and it would have delayed a lot the delivery of the Platform. 
            I took the responsibility to hold the business' hands and subtly nudge them in the right direction.</p>
