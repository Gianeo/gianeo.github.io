        <p>All begins with an idea; the idea to develop a platform to empower worldwide retail grocery businesses to operate online successfully like Ocado is doing in the UK. This is the beginning of the development of a suite of solutions that will be built upon the Ocado retail experience and the in-house technology.</p>
        <p>Because of its technology-driven culture, in the Ocado Smart Platform team all efforts where put on the engineering work, leaving design [and a bit of product planning] aside.</p>
        <p>After several month of development, all applications looked poorly built and disconnected. It become clear to some that something had to change in order to properly build and scale an ecosystem.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h5>Problem #2</h5> 
          <p>Because dev teams worked autonomously from each other (without any design chapter), each app worked and looked differently from the other. Platform's coherence was missing and the demo sessions regularly showcased how the customer experience was broken.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h5>Problem #3</h5> 
          <p>The assumption of being able to simply copy ocado.com for the B2C revealved to have been a not functional idea; too many user experience nuances and design requirements were not considered.</p>

          <!-- <h1>Who or what is their guide in solving the problem?</h1> -->
          <p>I was leading the UX and Design of the Speciality Store (General Merchindise Platform) when the Head of eCommerce OSP approached me to share his challenges. He asked me if I could spend a bit of my time to support OSP with some designs thus to primarily solve problem #2. And of course, a few designs would not have solved the problem but enthusisastically I agreed in helping out.</p>
          <p>Few weeks later, with visual concepts to support my vision, I pitched the need of design to takkle the OSP challenges.</p>
          <p>Soon after, I was officially leading the UX and Design for the Ocado Smart Platform.</p>
          <p class="gf-text-small">PS: For the first six months, I had to split my responsibilities between OSP and leading the Design for the Speciality Stores; I would have moved full-time to OSP soon after launching Fabled.com, the beauty commerce site built in partnership with Marie Claire.</p>

        <p>To start delivering consistency and brand across all apps within the Platform, I needed to equip the organisation with a short-term vision and strategy while bringing excitement for the challenge.</p>
        <p>After three months, the Management team started seeing demos of products that were more cohesive within the Platform; they felt as being part of a whole. It didn't take long that board members and a dedicated team started demoing the Platform to potential clients with more confidence.</p>

          <p>After struggling in finding valid senior designers (mostly because of location), I changed my strategy and started looking for fast learner humble young talented designers with a strong mindset in problem solving and happy to jump into the mad.</p>
          <p>I spent some time with their future stakeholders so to prepare the field and not let things to chances.</p>
          <p>After the first two hires, I started raising the experience level. My goal was to set up a team with a diverse level of experience so to spread responsibilities and ownership.
          I chose to scale the team according to my team and the other stakeholder maturity with processes.</p>

        <h3>The OSP Tube Map</h3>
        <p>How can we clearly explain internally and externally how OSP works, from B2B to the B2C? Inspired by the London tube map, we concieved and created the OSP Tube Map, a user journey map of the platform's functionality that incorporates all the high-level actions that must be taken by the retailer and shopper to make OSP efficient. Every new feature will be regularly added to the map; and a beautiful, enormous printed wall version of it was made available in our offices across Europe (often used efficiently in workshops and brainstorming).</p>

          <p>I partnered with the most senior front-end engineer to design and develop a unified design language [to then becomea an MVP of a Design System]. We started with Bootstrap to then move into a more ad hoc solution built in React and Angular.</p>
          <p>When serving 20+ product teams spread out in different sites in Europe, delivering a unified front-end experience is a very bumpy journey.</p>
          <p>After three versions and many love/hate conversations, a dedicated ad hoc full-time team of engineers was built to facilitate and optimise the building and delivery of a more robust Design System.</p>

        <h3>Fraisy, the Design Language and System for B2C</h3>
        <p>The Ocado retail and eCommerce OSP team were looking at the customer-facing experience from the rear mirror instead of looking ahead. They expected to copy and paste the current ocado.com to the OSP experience.</p>
        <p>Because of my experience in designing Ocado.com web shop and apps as well as having the confidence and experience as a designer, I was well aware of what would have worked and what not at this stage (MVP thinking). I took initiative and the risk to design the vision for the OSP B2C products; essentially the next version of Ocado.com (yes, Ocado will eventually be using the Ocado Smart Platform).</p>
        <p>Regardless of some friction and fatigue from some stakeholders on my vision, we started, piece by piece, building the components. After several iterations and learnings in the making, the eCommerce team started releasing a customer experience that pleased and fulfilled the brand customisation and business needs of acquired clients as well as capturing the attention of several interested retailers. OSP became a chosen solution to many international retailers such as Kruger (US), Sobeys (Canada), Casino and Monoprix (France), Bonpreu (Catalogna), Ica (Sweden), and Morrisons (UK).</p>
        <p>The customer-facing commerce experience was build upon a component-based Design System initiated by me and then scaled and developed by the developers and designers of the OSP eCommerce team.</p>

        <p>Design Thinking is most of the times misunderstood because of its over-complicated consultancy style definition. Design Thinking is a straightforward yet powerful process and mindset that when properly understood and applied, can open doors to extraordinary opportunities.</p>
        <p>To deliver that message and to build a solid bridge between design and tech, I being running an intro to Design Thinking workshop across multiple and diverse teams in all the Ocado offices across Europe. Using dating and creating social events as a way to explain Design Thinking not only triggered much interest but helped the participants to understand the meaning of being human-centric quickly.</p>

          We never look back to understand why something worked well and succeeded.
          No one would ever know what OSP would have been today if I didn't spend family time to design what OSP could look as a favour to a friend.</p>
          <p>OSP would have surely still had a happy ending, maybe it would have taken longer, more costly, uglier. Maybe the relationship with a few retailers would have been tougher. But who knows ... and who am I to say what it would have happen if. The if ... else conditional statement is meaningless.

        <p><b>I built, scaled, and coached</b> an international multi-disciplinary UX team (Researchers, Architects, Designers and UI Engineers).</p>
        <p><b>I directed</b> all aspects of UX and the UI design of the Ocado Smart Platform (Desktop and Mobile B2B and B2C applications).</p>
        <p><b>I defined and executed</b> the user experience vision, strategy, team's code of conduct, user-centred design direction and guidelines.</p>
        <p><b>I enriched</b> a strong technology-based culture by injecting a more user-centred and problem-solving mindset and process.</p>
        <p><b>I liaised</b> with designers, developers, and product owners to implement new conceptual ideas.</p>
        <p><b>I facilitated</b> multi-disciplinary teams' collaboration across Ocado's international offices (UK, Poland, and Barcelona).</p>

           <h3>Mistakes</h3>
           <p>Assuming that senior management would understand and embrace the benefits of design.</p>

        <div>
           <h3>Wins</h3>
           <p>I made the protagonist of the story the Board management team instead of the client. Focusing on the client/customer would have meant losing the sight of the business goal and it would have delayed a lot the delivery of the Platform. 
            I took the responsibility to hold the business' hands and subtly nudge them in the right direction.</p>
