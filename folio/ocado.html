                        <div class="uk-width-xlarge">
                            <p>I was freelancing in Italy when I was invited to have a phone interview with Ocado. Ocado who? I asked myself. I did some research, and my heart started hammering when I read about Ocado's vision was to disrupt the online shopping for grocery.</p>

                            <p>In Ocado, I joined a young growing team made by designers and front-end developers. With the support of the Head of UX, I was able to revamp some user experience patterns as well as most of the UI design of the under-construction webshop to make it as user-friendly and visually appealing as I could.</p>

                            <p>In partnership with the retail team, headed up by a visionary Head, with instinct and madness, we broke apart and reinvented any user-centred design process; we defined what the user experience for grocery in the UK would be for years to come.</p>

                            <p>The madness (sarcastically) continued when six months later we decided to rebrand Ocado entirely. Pure adventure for a passionate designer as myself. I welcomed the madness because it gave us the chance to fix many UX and design issues that, in the meantime, we learnt from our users.</p>

                            <p>Before the new work started, I was promoted to Manager. Together with Cantara, a talented young designer which I hired, we started redesigning ocado.com and the award-winning IOS apps with the new branding.</p>

                            <p>We released the new ocado.com and IOS apps in 2012, and most that work is still (early 2018) proudly standing regardless of the many well visible design issues.

                            <p>Soon after the release, I considered my work done. Luckily, a new adventure was waiting for me. I moved to the new General Merchandise department to design and lead the UX efforts for the new Ocado's specialised shops.</p>

                        <p class="article-copy uk-width-large@m">The first two challenges in a design and developer relationship are communication and expectation. The developer expects to receive a final graphic outcome that will survive storms and fire. Unfortunately, that almost never happens. The conversion from a static design file to code can sometimes reawaken the creative side of the designer’s brain. When that happens, the designer requests design adjustments (often called improvements) that test the developer’s patience. With time, such cases build frustration on both sides, and the project pays the final price. We started investing time and resources (hiring an extra UI engineer) to prototype in high fidelity. We stopped sending Sketch files to developers and began delivering tested, validated and well-documented prototypes built with our design system. The advantages were clear: improved communication between all parties, increased confidence with the design team, clearer guidelines for the developers and a faster release process of the product’s features.</p>
