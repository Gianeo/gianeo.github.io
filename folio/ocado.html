                        <div class="uk-width-xlarge">
                            <p>I was freelancing in Italy when I was invited to have a phone interview with Ocado. Ocado who? I asked myself. I did some research, and my heart started hammering when I read about Ocado's vision was to disrupt the online shopping for grocery.</p>

                            <p>In Ocado, I joined a young growing team made by designers and front-end developers. With the support of the Head of UX, I was able to revamp some user experience patterns as well as most of the UI design of the under-construction webshop to make it as user-friendly and visually appealing as I could.</p>

                            <p>In partnership with the retail team, headed up by a visionary Head, with instinct and madness, we broke apart and reinvented any user-centred design process; we defined what the user experience for grocery in the UK would be for years to come.</p>

                            <p>The madness (sarcastically) continued when six months later we decided to rebrand Ocado entirely. Pure adventure for a passionate designer as myself. I welcomed the madness because it gave us the chance to fix many UX and design issues that, in the meantime, we learnt from our users.</p>

                            <p>Before the new work started, I was promoted to Manager. Together with Cantara, an entry-level designer which I hired, we started redesigning ocado.com and the award-winning IOS apps with the new branding.</p>

                            <p>We released the new ocado.com and IOS apps in 2012, and most that work is still (early 2018) proudly standing regardless of the many well visible design issues.

                            <p>Soon after the release, I considered my work done. Luckily, a new adventure was waiting for me. I moved to the new General Merchandise department to design and lead the UX efforts for the new Ocado's specialised shops.</p>
