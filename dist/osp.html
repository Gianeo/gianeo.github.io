          <h4>How it all started...</h4>
          <p>I was leading the UX and Design of the Speciality Stores (the new Ocado's General Merchandise Platform) when the Head of eCommerce OSP approached me to talk about the OSP challenges. He asked me if I could spend a bit of my [free] time to support OSP with some visuals, thus to solve probably the most diminutive of all issues. Regardless of being fully aware that a few made-up nice graphics would not have solved the bigger problem, enthusiastically I agreed to help out.</p>
          <p>After a few weeks of fun in putting together concepts and vision, I pitched the need for design to facilitate and speed up in making the Ocado Smart Platform a friendlier product.</p>
          <p>Soon after, I was officially responsible for initiating and leading the UX and Design Chapter of the Ocado Smart Platform.</p>

                  <p>Because of its technology-driven culture, in the Ocado Smart Platform team, all efforts were put on the engineering work, leaving design [and a bit of product planning] aside.</p>
                  <p>After several months of development, all applications looked poorly built and disconnected. It become apparent to some that something had to change to properly develop and scale a friendly and scalable ecosystem.</p>

                <p>After struggling in finding adequate senior designers (mostly because of location), I changed my strategy. I started looking for young fast-learners with good enough craftsmanship with a problem-solving mindset and excited to jump into madness.</p>
                <p>To facilitate the new hires' start, I spent a good junk of my time with their future stakeholders to set expectations as well as setting up a training framework.</p>
                <p>After the first two hires, I started raising the experience level. My goal was to set up a team with a diverse class of experience so to spread responsibilities and ownership properly.</p>
                <p>The team grew organically across different office locations. Each member of the Design Chapter worked in cross-functional teams while supporting each other and the Chapter by leading activities such as the UX Academy, the Research community, the UX two-weeks work experience for PMs and Developers, etc.</p>

                <h3>The OSP Tube Map</h3>
                <p>How can we clearly explain internally and externally how OSP works, from B2B to the B2C online shop? Inspired by the London tube map, we conceived and created the OSP Tube Map, a user journey map to visually describe the platform's functionality.</p>
                <p>In a visual story-teller way, the OSP Tube Map described the flow, and all the retailer and its customer's needed actions to complete the purchase's process.</p>
                <p>The map was regularly updated with new ideated and released features. A beautiful, enormous printed wall version of the map was made available in all Ocado Technology offices (often used efficiently in workshops and brainstorming).</p>

                <h3>Aeris, the Design System for the OSP B2B</h3>
                <div class="copy-columns">
                  <p>I partnered with the most senior front-end engineer to design and develop a unified design language [the first step to become an MVP of a Design System]. We started with Bootstrap to then move into a more ad hoc solution built in React [and Angular].</p>
                  <p>When serving 20+ product teams spread out in different international locations, delivering a centralised front-end experience was a very bumpy journey.</p>
                  <p>Every designer working on the B2B products [embedded in multi-disciplinary teams] were actively contributing to enhance the capability and adequately scale the Design System. Unfortunately, we couldn't afford to have a dedicated team of designers. We couldn't afford to have a dedicate team of engineers, either. All the engineering work was volunteer-based, and only God knows how grateful I have been towards those lovely people.</p>
                  <p>After three years from the first Aeris release, and after Kroger (US retailer) signing into OSP, the time was right to set up a dedicated team of engineers to work fulltime on the OSP Design System.</p>
                  <p class="italic">PS: On its fourth version, the team decided to rename Aeris DS to OSP DS as a sign of its maturity.</p>

                <div class="copy-columns">
                  <p>The Ocado retail and eCommerce OSP team were looking at the customer-facing experience from the rear mirror instead of looking ahead. They expected to copy and paste the current ocado.com experience to the OSP online shop.</p>
                  <p>With my experience in designing Ocado.com and the support of a two-year product roadmap, I embraced my responsibility and delivered the vision of the OSP B2C products. Essentially, I designed the future version of Ocado.com (yes, Ocado will eventually be using the Ocado Smart Platform).</p>
                  <p>Regardless of some friction caused by some stakeholders on my vision, component after component, we started building the online shop. After several iterations and learnings in the making, the eCommerce team started releasing a customer experience that pleased the business as well as newly acquired and potential clients.</p>
                  <p>In my time working on it, OSP became a chosen solution to many international retailers such as Kruger (US), Sobeys (Canada), Groupe Casino (France), Bonpreu (Catalogna), Ica (Sweden), and Morrisons (UK).</p>

                    <p>Design Thinking is often misunderstood because of its over-complicated consultancy style definition and strict methodology. Design Thinking, as I see it, is a straightforward yet powerful process and mindset that when properly understood and applied, can open doors to extraordinary opportunities.</p>
                    <p>To deliver that message and to build a firm bridge between design, product and tech, I planned and facilitated Design Thinking workshops across multiple and diverse teams in all the Ocado Technology offices. Using ordinary life examples as a way to explain Design Thinking not only triggered interest and engagement but helped the participants to understand the meaning of being human-centric quickly.</p>

            <p>No one would ever know what OSP would have been today if I disagreed on spending some of my free time to craft its vision as a favour to a friend.</p>
            <p>Without any doubt, OSP would have had still a happy ending. Maybe it would have taken longer and costlier; Perhaps negotiations with retailers' brand and marketing teams would have been more challenging. I'm almost sure it would have been messier and uglier.</p>
            <p>Who knows. As any philosopher would point out, the if/else conditional statement is always meaningless. What counts to me are my good memories, the fun and pain in working with bright minds careless clueless about design, and the current colossal success of OSP.</p>

            <p>Today Ocado is one of the most technologically and commercially relevant brands in the world.</p>
            <p>After the massive success – strategically and financially – that signing Kroger brought to Ocado in 2018, it came clear to me that, after four intense years in the making, from a design perspective, the <del>hard job</del> fun was over. The next two-years roadmap and with the ongoing leadership re-organisation, from that moment on, it was all about delivering the commitment.</p>
            <p>I wanted to push for excellence; however, "good enough design" was sufficient to please the business (perhaps rightly so at that stage), and that it is what we delivered.</p>
            <p>Respectfully, it was time for me to move on to pastures new. On the bright side, my departure proposed the opportunity for some of my beloved senior designers to take leadership roles and shape the products according to their vision; undoubtedly, I'll always be cheering for them.</p>

                    Gianni is a machine - with a human touch. Having dealt with many internal stakeholders and external clients I have to admit I have never met anyone as dedicated and passionate as Gianni. He is well respected within Ocado Technology, for not only being smart, fun and fast but predominately being an exceptional creative designer. He will always try to keep pushing the boundaries not just for himself but also for his team members and the business. Personally, every company needs a Gianni in their design team as exceptional results with a cheeky smile will always be guaranteed!
