      <h1>Zopa Bank</h1>
      <h2>Head of Experience Design</h2>

      <div style="background: url(images/photos/zopa/0-4.jpg) no-repeat; background-size: cover;">

        <p>In 2020, Zopa started a new chapter in their journey, officially launching Zopa Bank alongside their P2P business. Zopa plans to offer FSCS protected deposit accounts, credit cards, and a money management app which makes use of data made available by the introduction of Open Banking.</p>

              <p><b>Built, scaled, and coached</b> a team of Product and Service Designers.</p>
              <p><b>Defined and executed</b> the user experience vision, strategy and tactics, team's code of conduct, user-centred design direction and guidelines.</p>
              <p><b>Liaised</b> with designers, developers, product managers, and business leaders to implement new conceptual ideas while developing and scaling a Design System.</p>
              <p><b>Collaborated with the brand team</b> to help ensure consistent tone of voice and appropriate design across all digital customer channels.</p>
              <p><b>Enriched</b> an emerging technology and finance-based culture by injecting a more user-centred and problem-solving mindset and process.</p>
              <p><b>Identified and drove</b> emerging digital initiatives associated with usability, accessibility and design.</p>

          <p>Gianni was instrumental in setting up our user experience design practice at Zopa – as soon as he came in, he managed to get the best out of the existing designers thanks to a set of effective design processes. He was also very effective in quickly assembling a team of strong individuals, one of them then went on to win the Zopian of month just a few months after joining. The team went on to receive high praise throughout the business and won Zopa’s team of the week award after helping to redesign our website and app in time for our bank launch.</p>
          <p>I can highly recommend Gianni if you are trying to create an effective design team that works well with the rest of the business. Gianni is also a very effective mentor and manager for the designers themselves.</p>

                <p>I embrace change, and I always share my love for it with my team. I believe "change" is a decisive agent for testing and shaping your character.</p>
                <p>In March 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic forced many out of their jobs while the lucky ones had to work from home. For now, we are part of the lucky bunch. Acknowledging this fact helped us to be grateful and to stay focused on the challenges and tasks ahead of us. Luckily, we were able to welcome to the team and build rapport with our new hires before the lockdown. This is a group of terrific human beings and being able to bond in no time adequately equipped the team well to minimise disruption.</p>

                <h2>Design Thinking</h2>
                <p>Design Thinking has been a valid tool to explain and deliver design in several areas of the business. I have been facilitating my own Design Thinking workshop across the organisation, from HR to Product teams. It's all about solving humans' problems, so why not introduce design as a tool to solve problems such as planning an effective business's social event?</p>

              <h2>Play and Learn</h2>
              <p>"Play and Learn" is the preservation of my old tradition to spend the last hours of the working week in personal and team development. Friday afternoons are, in most cases, not very productive. So, why don’t use that positive pre-weekend energy to do something fun and constructive? Every team member has the chance to facilitate and lead an activity; from workshops to Ted style talks, we strive to learn and practice new perspectives and skills. Are these sessions just for designers? Absolutely not, we promote, welcome, and love to have any curious mind joining us.
