    The role of the designer
    Design thinkers that facilitate conversations and collaboration to align ideas around people needs and busness opportunities
    And the prototypers
    
    Design alignment... deliver a great product experience aligned to everything the business is delivering. To be trustworthy and coherent as a business
    Example... design focus only on iphone but not on packaging and marketing would have been a disaster.
    
    Culture is key
    Cultuale development
    
    Design... I can’t convince you about design, but I can tell you about the consequences of not including design
    
    Sell the benefits of design and not the how
    
    Hire self-starters
    
    To be successfully strategic in design, you need to listen to the people empathically and understand the business’ model. Act according to the organisation design maturity, cognitive motivations, and business' expectations. Look at the shape and size of the aperture before picking the right peg – or you might end up trying to force a square peg into a round hole. Avoid any cookie-cutter thinking.
